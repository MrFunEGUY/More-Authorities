[h1]3 New Authorities:[/h1]

- Democratic Autocracy:

- This system of government democratically elects a dictator for life. When your ruler  dies, a new one will be elected the same as in democracies, with faction support mattering and whatnot.

- This authority doesn't require egalitarian or authoritarian ethics, makings it very versatile. You can also hold emergency elections, but remember that they will be democratic elections where you can't guarantee the winner.

- You can choose to have a new election at any time with this authority, like in normal democracies, if you want to change your ruler. If you do so, your current leader will disappear. This simulates retirement.

----

- Single Term Democracy:

- This government form elects a ruler for a single 15-year term. After their term, leaders will go back to whatever job they had before (scientist, governor, admiral, general). If it's the initial leader, they will become a governor. This government cannot be reformed out of easily. Read more about that farther down. My logic with this was that I wanted a government with such tight checks on power that it would be stupidly difficult for any one leader to remove term limits within their 15-year term.

- The only way to reform out of a Single Term government is to use another new edict. It'll cost you 1000 Influence.

- The reason I had to make an edict for the ability to reform into and out of this government type is because Stellaris doesn't let you determine how much influence it costs to reform your government.

- You'll lose any invalid civics.

- You'll have to wait 5 years after this to reform your government. Consider this the price you have to pay to political allies and opponents alike in order to get these massive reforms through.

- You can still reform a single term government to add more civics.

----

- Private Corporate

- This government is a megacorp that has a monarchy. It's a megacorp, but with Rulers for life and Heirs, just like Imperial authority.

- This authority is the one most likely to not play well with some mods, but seeing as how I play with around 180 mods, I'm doing my best to make patches that work for the biggest mods. This mod is easy to patch for though, so please ask me if you need a patch for a specific mod. I will likely be able to provide it.

- For ethics, you must be some form of competitive, no form of egalitarian/libertarian, and not a gestalt consciousness. If you have ECA and the patch installed, you need to be some form of authoritarian and some form of competitive.

[h1]Credits:[/h1]

I highly recommend the mods below.

---

- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1255082381]Tovius and their mod Expanded Mandates.[/url] This would not have been possible without looking at how he did term limits for an event. Make sure you use my patch above if you use this.

---

- [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2108467150]Emperor Scorpio and their mod Kingmaker 2.7 (Out of date).[/url] This mod helped me understand how to set governments via edict. I now recommend using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2211461998]Regentmaker, by FirePrince.[/url] It's a spiritual successor to Kingmaker.

---

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1790861374]Petruxa and their mod Ethics and Civics Alternative 2.7.[/url] Helped me understand how to add new governments and authority types.

[h1]The Future:[/h1]

I'll probably add more authorities eventually, as I think of them. I'll also be looking at ways to make term limits more interesting.

---

Let me know about any bugs or anything else, this took way longer to make than I anticipated.
